## How to use

Type the command into the input fiels and see the Robot execute it!

### Available commands

#### ðŸ¥ƒ Classic challenge:

- `PLACE x y Facing` - places the robot on the board at the coordinates you set
- `LEFT` - rotates the robot 90 degrees left
- `RIGHT` - rotates the robot 90 degrees right
- `MOVE` - move robot 1 tile towards where it's facing

The `REPORT` of where the Robot is permanently available underneath the board.

#### ðŸš€ 3D Expansion:

- `OBSTACLE x y` - places an obstacle on the board. Up to 4 obstacles can be stacked in each cell
- `ROTOR START` - spins up the rotor
- `ROTOR STOP` - stops the rotor
- `UP` - move up by one unit (max 4 units possible)
- `DOWN` - move down by one unit

**Limitations and other features**

- Robot **can not move off the board**, or outside of the control range (4 units up) when airborn.
- `ROTOR START` command is needed for any airborne activities.
- If Rotor is stopped when the robot is above an obstacle, **the robot will fall down and crash** and won't be able to take any more commands.
- `Back` button rewinds the robot to the previous state in history.
